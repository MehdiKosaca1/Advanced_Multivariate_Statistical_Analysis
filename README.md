# Advanced Multivariate Statistical Analysis Using R, SAS, and SPSS
This project involves an in-depth multivariate statistical analysis using powerful tools like R, SAS, and SPSS. The analysis is based on a dataset of 1,000 observations and 14 variables collected from hospitals in India for early-stage heart disease detection. It integrates advanced statistical techniques and machine learning approaches to uncover insights and patterns.

## Overview of the Project
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted detailed descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify patterns, anomalies, and distribution of variables. Focused on identifying outliers, evaluating skewness, and analyzing the relationships between variables like blood pressure, cholesterol, and age.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Used to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance. Key variables like serum cholesterol and blood pressure were identified as having significant contributions. Results show that the first few components explained a substantial proportion of the variance.

### Discriminant Analysis:
Implemented to predict the target variable (presence of heart disease) based on multiple predictors. The analysis assessed group separation, identified significant predictors like blood pressure, and evaluated the effectiveness of the discriminant functions.

### Cluster Analysis:
Grouped observations into clusters based on similarities in variables such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Three distinct clusters were identified, each with unique health profiles, providing actionable insights for targeted interventions.

### Logistic Regression Analysis:
Developed a predictive model to classify the presence of heart disease. Variables such as resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate were significant predictors. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 77.2%, highlighting its potential in clinical decision-making.

This project showcases the application of multivariate statistical methods in healthcare analytics. By leveraging R, SAS, and SPSS, it combines robust statistical methodologies with cutting-edge software capabilities to deliver reliable and actionable insights.
